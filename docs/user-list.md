# Admin Pages: User Management

## Overview
This document outlines the user management functionality available in the admin section of our attendance tracking POC application.

## Access Control
- Only users with `is_admin` flag set to `true` can access these pages
- Admin status is verified on both client and server side for each request

## User Management Dashboard

### User Listing
- Display a table of all users in the system
- Table columns:
  - ID
  - Email
  - Name
  - Admin Status
  - PTP Status
  - Actions

### Sorting and Filtering
- Allow sorting by columns: ID, Email, Name
- Provide a search bar to filter users by email or name

## User Operations

### Create New User
- Form fields:
  - Email (required, unique)
  - Password (required)
  - Name (optional)
  - Admin Status (checkbox)
- Generate initial PTP upon user creation

### Edit User
- Allow editing of all user fields except ID
- Option to reset user's PTP

### Delete User
- Soft delete: Deactivate user account
- Hard delete: Remove user from database (with confirmation)

### Reset PTP
- Button to reset a user's PTP
- Generate and display new PTP for admin to communicate to user

## Bulk Operations
- Select multiple users
- Bulk actions:
  - Delete selected users
  - Reset PTP for selected users

## User Details View
- Detailed view of user information
- Display user's attendance history
- Option to export user's attendance data

## PTP Management
- View current PTP status for each user
- Reset PTP functionality
- PTP history log (last 5 PTPs with timestamps)

## Admin Actions Log
- Record all admin actions related to user management
- Log entries include:
  - Action type (create, edit, delete, reset PTP)
  - Affected user(s)
  - Timestamp
  - Admin who performed the action

## API Endpoints

### Get All Users
- Endpoint: `GET /api/admin/users`
- Query parameters for sorting and filtering

### Create User
- Endpoint: `POST /api/admin/users`
- Request body: User details

### Edit User
- Endpoint: `PUT /api/admin/users/:id`
- Request body: Updated user details

### Delete User
- Endpoint: `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id`

### Reset User PTP
- Endpoint: `POST /api/admin/users/:id/reset-ptp`

### Get User Details
- Endpoint: `GET /api/admin/users/:id`
- Include user's attendance history

## Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting on admin APIs
- Log all admin actions for audit purposes
- Ensure proper input validation and sanitization

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Consistent dark theme across admin pages
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Confirm destructive actions (delete, reset PTP) with modal dialogs
- Provide feedback for all actions (success/error messages)

## Future Enhancements
- Implement pagination for user listing
- Add user roles beyond binary admin/non-admin
- Introduce more advanced filtering and reporting capabilities

Note: This user management system is designed for a POC. In a production environment, additional security measures and features would be necessary.
